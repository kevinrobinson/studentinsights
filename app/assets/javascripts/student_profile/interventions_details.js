        <p>The Notes tab is the place to keep notes about a student, whether it’s SST, MTSS, \
        a parent conversation, or some informal strategies that a teacher/team is using to help a student. \
        More formal strategies (e.g. the student meets with a tutor or counselor every week) should be recorded in Services.</p> \

        <p><b>Who can enter a note?</b> \
        Anyone who works with or involved with the student, \
        including classroom/ELL/SPED teachers, principals/assistant principals, counselors, and attendance officers.</p> \
        <br> \
        <p><b>What can/should I put in a note?</b> \
        <br> \
        The true test is to think about whether the information will help your \
        team down the road in supporting this student, either in the coming weeks, or a few years from now. Examples include:</p> \
        <br> \
        <ul> \
          <li>"Oscar just showed a 20 point increase in ORF. \
          It seems like the take home readings are working (parents are very supportive) and we will continue it."</li> \
          <li>"This is a follow-up MTSS meeting for Julie. Over the last 4 weeks, \
          she is not showing many gains despite the volunteer tutor and the change in seating…."</li> \
          <li>"Alex just got an M on the latest F&P. Will try having him go next door to \
          join the other 4th grade group during guided reading."</li> \
          <li>"51a filed on 3/21. Waiting determination and follow-up from DCF."</li> \
          <li>"Just found that Cora really likes to go help out in grade 1. \
          Best incentive yet for when she stays on task and completes work."</li> \
          <li>"Arranged for Kevin to go to community schools 2x/week and to get extra homework help."</li> \
          <li>"Julia will do an FBA and report back at the next SST meeting to determine sources of the behavior."</li> \
          <li>"Mediation occurred between Oscar and Uri and went well. Both have agreed to keep distance for 2 weeks."</li> \
          <li>"Parent called to report that Jill won art award and will be going to nationals. \
          She suggested this might be an outlet if she shows frustration in schoolwork."</li> \
        </ul> \
        <br> \
        <p><b>What is a Restricted Note?</b> \
        <br> \
        Restricted Notes are only visible to the Principal, AP, and guidance counselors. \
        If a note contains sensitive information about healthcare, courts, or child abuse, think about using a Restricted Note.\
        <br> \
        This feature is currently in development. \
        <br> \
        <br> \
        <ul> \
          <li>"51a filed on 3/21. Waiting determination and follow-up from DCF."</li> \
          <li>"Medicine change for Uri on 4/10. So far slight increase in focus."</li> \

        <br> \
        <p>The types of Services are:</p> \
        <ul> \
          <li><b>Reading Teacher:</b> Student works with a reading specialist at least 4x/week for 30-40 minutes.</li> \
          <li><b>Behavior/Attendance Contract:</b>This is usually done in cooperation with the attendance officer, \
          school adjustment counselor, and/or principal. This is a more formal document that requires a parent and \
          student signature, along with regular checkpoints.</li> \
         <li><b>Attendance Officer:</b> This usually includes home visit(s), regular follow-up, \
         and could later on lead to a formal attendance contract.</li> \
         <li><b>Counseling:</b> Student receives regular weekly or bi-weekly counseling from an SPS counselor or outside \
         (ex. Riverside, Home for Little Wanderers). One time or infrequent check-ins by a counselor should \
         just be recorded in Notes.</li> \
        </ul> \
        <br> \
